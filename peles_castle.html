                        <p>Resting in the heart of the Bucegi Mountains in the mesmerizing town of Sinaia, the Peleș Castle is a masterpiece of the German architecture, considered as one of the most beautiful and stunning palaces in Europe.</p>

                        <p>The Peleș Castle was commissioned by King Carol in 1873 which was completed in 1883. The castle served as the summer home for the Royal family until 1947. There are a 160 rooms with each room adorned with the finest examples of the European art. Murano crystal chandeliers, German stained glass windows and Cordoba leather covered walls.</p>

                        <p> During the construction of the castle, King Carol spared no expense. The Castle was the first of its kind to have electricity and has its own power plant aswell. The Castle has hot and cold water running tap system along with a central heat and vacuum system. The stain glass roof of the concourse open mechanically and the castle also features an elevator which was used by the Royal family.</p>

                        <p> Every part of the room is designed and decorated in a different theme and style. The concert hall and the music room are designed in an Indian theme, a Turkish salon, The Great Salon in Italian, the Council room from Switzerland, the moor hall from the German culture and much more. The castle also has many secret doors.</p>

                        <p> There’s a 60 seat theatre made out entirely of solid gold along with a Royal box that projected its first movie in the year 1906. The Castle was named Peleș after the Pele Creek that lies close by and passes right through the courtyard.</p>

                        <p>The furniture in the music room is carved of teak which was a gift to King Carol from the Maharaja of Kapurtala in India. The hand make silk embroideries covering the ceilings and walls in the salon represent a Turkish culture. The ceiling paintings and decorates in the Theatre were designed by the famous Austrian artists Gustav Klimpt and Frantz Matsch.</p>

                        <p>Over 4000 monumental pieces are up for display inside the Castle today. Later on King Ferdinand, who succeeded Carol ordered a smaller, art nouveau-style Pelisor Castle close by.
